1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

I think the most interesting topic was linkage disequilibrium, which refers to a phenomenon where a group of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in a particular region are correlated with a certain gene expression, but only a few of these SNPs have a causal impact on the gene expression. The processes to identify the causal SNPs, including pruning and thresholding, are interesting. It was also interesting to learn that the diseases with more SNPs with more stringent thresholds indicate a higher complexity of the disease since that disease is caused by multiple SNPs. 

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
   
A potential investigation that I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is a rare variant analysis where we investigate the impact of the rare genetic variants that might be underrepresented but still significant on the gene expression in this dataset. A drawback of this is that this dataset is relatively small, so it may be harder to identify significant rare variants. Another potential investigation is to do fine mapping to identify which SNPs have a causal relationship with certain traits.
